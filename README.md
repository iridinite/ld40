## The Floor is Lava

This is the source code for my LD40 entry. It's a game about falling down as fast as you can without touching the ground. But: the longer you fall, the faster the game moves and the faster you have to react. Along the way you'll find hazards, as well as crazy powerups to help you.

This was made in 48 hours during LD40. The theme was "the more you have, the worse it is".
